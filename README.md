# bloom_filter 
Bloom Filter with naive scalability. 
Bloom filter is a widely used probabilistic data structure, that is used to answer whether an element is present in a set or not. If the bloom filter answers **"NO"**, it means the element is **definitely** not present, but if the filter answers **"YES"**, then there is a chance that the element is present in the set, or not. Bloom filter is basically a space-time trade off with accuracy.
